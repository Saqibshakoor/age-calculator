ðŸš€ Exciting News! ðŸš€
I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed a project as part of my internship with CodeAlpha . ðŸŽ‰
The project was an Age Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool allows users to input their birthdate and instantly find out their age in years, months, and days. This project was a great learning experience and provided me with valuable insights into front-end development.
Key Features:
User-friendly interface
Accurate age calculation
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the team at CodeAlpha for their guidance and support throughout this project. Their mentorship has been instrumental in enhancing my coding skills and understanding of web development.
Feel free to check out the project here and let me know your thoughts
